# Networking 

These challenges focus on you figuring out how stuff works. They go from easy to not so easy. (Challenges 1-3 written by NuclearFarmboy, challenge 4 written by ExpertCactus)

### NETWORKING1: You Just Got Served  
This is funny. You can see it all. Run this server on a port of your choice. You need to send the flag flag{y0u_say_hell0!} to the server and you'll get a reply.

THE TWIST!

You have to use the command line. And you can't write your own client/get one from the internet/stack overflow. 

The flag is what command did you use to 

**VALUE: 1 point||**
**FLAG: the command you used**

### NETWORKING2: Pop a Cap!
The flag is somewhere in there....

**VALUE: 2 points||**
**FLAG: flag{looks like this}**


### NETWORKING3: Halfway There
Here's a server. Write a client for it. And yes, I will test it to see if it can answer the riddles 3.

**VALUE: 3 points||**
**FLAG FORMAT: CODE!**

### NETWORKING4: 
Similar to Networking 2. BUT BETTER.

**VALUE: 4 points||**
**FLAG: it's in there!**
