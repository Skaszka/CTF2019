# Reverse Engineering

These challenges focus on you figuring out how stuff works. They go from easy to not so easy. (All challenges written by NuclearFarmboy)

### REVERSE1: Get Crackin!  
Here's a python code that we wrote to verify your bank pin. Can you solve for the pin?

**VALUE: 1 point||**
**FLAG: the PIN**

### REVERSE2: Get Crackalackin!
Hmmmm this python file looks funky when I open it in vim. Can you guess the bank pin?

**VALUE: 2 points||**
**FLAG: the PIN**


### REVERSE3: NotSoEnigmatic
A long time ago there was a war between ExpertCactus-topia and NuclearFarmboy-topia. Before the Great Mario Kart Battle of 2018, NuclearFarmboy decided to write an Enigma Machine to send messages to his troops in the frontline. Turns out he's not very good at designing Enigma Machines, and also he had no troops. What he did end up making was a machine that encoded his messages, and now when fed the FLAG it prints:

D1B{UY9DHENL9PNMOEUP

Can you decode it?

**VALUE: 3 points||**
**FLAG FORMAT: FLAG{XXXXXXXXXXX}**

### REVERSE4: CrackMe
So python is nice, but assembly is nicer. Can you take this apart and figure out what the password is?

**VALUE: 4 points||**
**FLAG: the password**

### REVERSE5: Return of the Crack
New binary, who dis?

**VALUE: 5 points||**
**FLAG: the password**
